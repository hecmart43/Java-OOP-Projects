# Java-OOP-Projects
This repository contains organized Java programming exercises and small projects demonstrating core object-oriented programming principles and fundamental algorithms.

## Topics Covered

- Basics (I/O, arithmetic, control flow)
- Conditionals and loops
- Methods and modular design
- Arrays and string processing
- Searching algorithms
- Sorting algorithms
- Data structures (stack implementation)
- Bitwise operations and number systems
- Object-oriented modeling using classes

## Structure

Each folder represents a specific topic area.  
Individual programs are small, focused implementations designed to demonstrate specific concepts.

## Environment

All programs were developed and tested using a standard Java development environment.
